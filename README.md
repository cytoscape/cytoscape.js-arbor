cytoscape-arbor
================================================================================


## Description

The Arbor physics simulation layout for Cytoscape.js

The `arbor` layout uses a [force-directed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) physics simulation.  For more information about Arbor and its parameters, refer to [its documentation](http://arborjs.org/reference).

Notes about Arbor:

 * For webworkers to work properly, you need to point your browser to a server URL (e.g. `http://`) rather than a local address (e.g. `file://`).
 * Please note that the `liveUpdate` option can potentially be expensive, so if you are concerned about running time (e.g. for large graphs), you should set it to `false`.
 * Arbor does some automatic path finding because it uses web workers, meaning you have to directly include it in a `<script>` in your `<head>`.  Therefore, you can not combine `arbor.js` with your other JavaScript files &mdash; as you probably would as a part of the minification of the scripts in your webapp.
 * You probably want to use the version of `arbor.js` included with Cytoscape.js (or the unpatched, original [`arbor.js`](http://arborjs.org) if you are unaffected by the issues it contains).


## Dependencies

 * Cytoscape.js >= 2.4.0
 * Arbor.js >= 0.91
 * jQuery, as required by Arbor


## Usage instructions

Download the library:
 * via npm: `npm install cytoscape-arbor`,
 * via bower: `bower install cytoscape-arbor`, or
 * via direct download in the repository (probably from a tag).

`require()` the library as appropriate for your project:

CommonJS:
```js
var cytoscape = require('cytoscape');
var cyarbor = require('cytoscape-arbor');
var arbor = require('arbor');

cyarbor( cytoscape, arbor ); // register extension
```

AMD:
```js
require(['cytoscape', 'cytoscape-arbor', 'arbor'], function( cytoscape, cyarbor, arbor ){
  cyarbor( cytoscape, arbor ); // register extension
});
```

Plain HTML/JS has the extension registered for you automatically, because no `require()` is needed.


## API

Call the layout, e.g. `cy.layout({ name: 'arbor', ... })`, with the following options:

```js
var defaults = {
  animate: true, // whether to show the layout as it's running
  maxSimulationTime: 4000, // max length in ms to run the layout
  fit: true, // on every layout reposition of nodes, fit the viewport
  padding: 30, // padding around the simulation
  boundingBox: undefined, // constrain layout bounds; { x1, y1, x2, y2 } or { x1, y1, w, h }
  ungrabifyWhileSimulating: false, // so you can't drag nodes during layout
  randomize: false, // uses random initial node positions on true

  // callbacks on layout events
  ready: undefined, // callback on layoutready
  stop: undefined, // callback on layoutstop

  // forces used by arbor (use arbor default on undefined)
  repulsion: undefined,
  stiffness: undefined,
  friction: undefined,
  gravity: true,
  fps: undefined,
  precision: undefined,

  // static numbers or functions that dynamically return what these
  // values should be for each element
  // e.g. nodeMass: function(n){ return n.data('weight') }
  nodeMass: undefined,
  edgeLength: undefined,

  stepSize: 0.1, // smoothing of arbor bounding box

  // function that returns true if the system is stable to indicate
  // that the layout can be stopped
  stableEnergy: function( energy ){
    var e = energy;
    return (e.max <= 0.5) || (e.mean <= 0.3);
  },

  // infinite layout options
  infinite: false // overrides all other options for a forces-all-the-time mode
};
```


## Publishing instructions

This project is set up to automatically be published to npm and bower.  To publish:

1. Set the version number environment variable: `export VERSION=1.2.3`
1. Publish: `gulp publish`
1. If publishing to bower for the first time, you'll need to run `bower register cytoscape-arbor https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js-arbor.git`
